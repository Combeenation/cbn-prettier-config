/**
 * All options starting with 'importOrder' come from plugin `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`.

 * Note HAR: I changed the format of this file from `json` to `.prettierrc.js` just to be able to add this comment which
 *           is not possible with JSON files at all (as far as I know)...
 * 
 *           Also I would have liked to place this info in some "importOrderNote" property, but prettier is then
 *           printing some "[warn] Ignored unknown option ..." warning for each file when running `npm run format`...
 * 
 *           I think the `$schema` is not "doing anything" anymore but I'm still leaving it e.g. for later reference ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
