/**
 * Notes on formatting SVG:
 *
 * - We're using the official [XML Plugin](@prettier/plugin-xml) even though that yields some strange results (ATM).
 *   See this ticket: https://github.com/prettier/plugin-xml/issues/648
 * - Another option would be to use prettiers HTML parser for SVG files as well using prettiers `override` option as
 *   explained [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5322#issuecomment-1276302630) but that had did not
 *   really work out of the box neither for the following reasons:
 *   - SVGs were not formatted when using the CLI with `npm run format`.
 *     Reason: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/11141
 *   - Someone stated that the HTML parser is not really XML/SVG compliant but I don't know if this statement from 2020
 *     is still true: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5322#issuecomment-620539554
 *   - I wasn't able to use formatting manually from within VSCode with this approach ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
